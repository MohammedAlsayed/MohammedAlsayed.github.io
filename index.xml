      <description>Hello World This is my first blog site that I made in my ever life. The technologies used are hugo for static site generating and github for hosting. Mr. Rayed my manager in the company inspired me with this great idea. Many thanks to Mr. Rayed. Maybe my next blog will be on how I made this blog but in arabic. I also have some other topics that I would like to include in the few next days.</description>
