      <description>Hello World This my first blog site that I made with hugo and github. Mr. Rayed my manager in the company inspired me with this great idea. Many thanks to Mr. Rayed. Maybe my next blog will be on how I made this blog but in arabic. I also have some other topics that I would like to include in the few next days.
Cheers!</description>
